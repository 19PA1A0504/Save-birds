    <h1>Endangered birds</h1>
    <p>There are many Endangered birds in our country. Due to radiation the birds become Endangered.Some of the birds are already extinct. We have to protect our birds. </p>
    <p>Is there anywhere in the world where research has found that birds are dying because of cell phone tower radiation? It is not exactly about death, but about impact. For example, research by Ruiz-Martinez in Spain concluded that as the radiation of cell phone towers increase,Â the bird population decreases.</p>
    <p>So please take care of birds.</p>
