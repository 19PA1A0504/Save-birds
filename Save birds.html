        <li>Habitat destruction</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Biggest threat to birds</h2>
    <p>It is little surprise, then, that habitat loss is the greatest threat to birds. There are few habitats on Earth that have not been affected by humans. As we modify and reshape the land around us, we damage or destroy natural habitat for birds.</p>
    <h2>Danger for birds</h2>
    <p>The most common dangerous obstacles include tall glass buildings, electrical wires and poles, wind turbines, and similar structures. Predators: Predators kill hundreds of thousands of birds each year, and during migration, migrating birds may be unaware of local predators at stopovers during their journey.</p>
